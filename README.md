For now I added some of my code for past 2+ months, more code related to DevOps cloud engineering can be found at https://github.com/DamWarCg <br/>
I also didn't import some of repositories for Azure DevOps because some of their code was made by someone else. I don't include the link because the organisation is private for pipeline agent purposes.<br/>
At least for now everything is just dumped there as I need more time to organise it better, maybe improve the code and import git history.<br/>
